# ventoy-bin

A new multiboot USB solution (Binary)

http://www.ventoy.net/

Ventoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/EFI files.
With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the ISO/WIM/IMG/EFI files to the USB drive and boot them directly.
You can copy many files at a time and ventoy will give you a boot menu to select them. Both Legacy BIOS and UEFI are supported in the same way. 470+ ISO files are tested.
A "Ventoy Compatible" concept is introduced by ventoy, which can help to support any ISO file.
