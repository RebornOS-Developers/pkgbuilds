1.5 Should individual clauses of these Terms and Conditions be invalid in whole or in part, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining clauses. The parties undertake to replace the invalid clause with another clause which comes as close as possible to the economic purpose of the invalid provision and is itself valid.

1.6 The contract language is English.

2. Offer and Subject of Contract

2.1 The range of services offered by ANYDESK is aimed exclusively at natural or legal persons or partnerships with legal capacity who, pursuant to Section 14 of the German Civil Code (BGB), act in the exercise of their commercial or self-employed professional activity when concluding a legal transaction (also referred to as "Customer" in these GTC and EGB). The online registration required for this purpose and the conclusion of the order shall be subject to the condition that the Customer is exercising a commercial or self-employed professional activity.

2.2 The subject matter of the contract results from these General and Supplementary Terms and Conditions, the supplementary terms and conditions that have priority in the scope of regulation and the Service Level Agreement, the Data Processing Agreement as well as from the service descriptions of the respective offers (https://anydesk.com/en/order). Any deviating provisions must be in writing.

2.3 Ancillary agreements or amendments to the contract require the written consent of ANYDESK in order to be effective.

2.4 Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, ANYDESK may also use the services of suitable third parties to fulfil its contractual obligations. In this case ANYDESK is liable for these third parties as for its own vicarious agents.

3. Contract Conclusion and Preconditions for Service Performance

3.1 A contract for the use of ANYDESK can be concluded both online by completing the order process and on the basis of an individual written offer. In the case of a written offer from ANYDESK to customers, this is deemed confirmed if the services offered are countersigned there without any changes; in this respect, telecommunication is sufficient to comply with the required written form (Section 127 (2) of the German Civil Code). A separate written order confirmation shall only apply in the event of a clear reference (naming of the offer/order and overall performance). Unless otherwise stated, the respective offer is only valid within two weeks after receipt of the offer. Order confirmations from ANYDESK replace an order from the customer if no objection is made in writing within two weeks; ANYDESK will expressly point out the significance of a failure to object in the order confirmation.

3.2 Subject to these terms, ANYDESK will provide you with a non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable licence to access and use the Services, as amended from time to time, during the term of the Agreement. By accepting these Terms, signing or initiating a binding order or using the services, a contract is formed based on these Terms and Conditions.

3.3 The customer is obliged to register the licence key in the portal https://my.anydesk.com or in the application within 14 days of receipt. ANYDESK reserves the right to restrict or block access to the services if the Customer fails to comply with the aforementioned.

3.4 Insofar as ANYDESK submits an offer to the Customer, this is deemed to be confirmed if the services offered therein are accepted without changes; unless otherwise stated, the respective offer is only valid until two weeks after receipt of the offer.

3.5 The Customer may access an installation manual and a user manual at https://support.anydesk.com at any time.

4. Description of Services, Availability and Technical Requirements

4.2 ANYDESK provides the use of the services with the availability and quality values defined in the applicable Service Level Agreement exclusively for chargeable products and Services and subject to the express agreement of a different Service Level. ANYDESK is only responsible for availability to the extent that the non-availability is attributable to the part of the network operated by it or the web or communication server of ANYDESK or the Client itself.

4.3 Regular maintenance work is necessary to ensure the availability of all services provided; ANYDESK may interrupt the provision of services for a defined period of time in order to carry out maintenance work. ANYDESK will announce the maintenance work to the Customer at https://status.anydesk.com. ANYDESK will, as far as possible, take the interests of the customer into account when scheduling the maintenance times. These regular maintenance times are not deemed to be an impairment of availability in the aforementioned sense.

4.4 The trouble-free use of the ANYDESK Software is dependent on the hardware and software of the mobile end devices, routers, data communication devices, etc. used by the User meeting the minimum technical requirements for the use of the software version currently offered, which the User can find in the respective current descriptions of the system requirements (https://support.anydesk.com/Minimum_System_Requirements).

4.5 The rollout / installation of the Client Software is the sole responsibility of the Customer. ANYDESK offers to support the Customer in this respect against payment on the basis of a separate agreement.

Furthermore, AnyDesk's services may not be used for unauthorised spying on data without the consent of the authorised owner of an end device. Conversely, the customer is obliged to prevent unauthorised access by third parties to protected data areas by taking suitable precautions. In the event of a culpable breach of the aforementioned provisions, the customer is liable for the resulting damage; the customer is obliged to indemnify ANYDESK against all claims by third parties based on such a breach of contract and to reimburse ANYDESK for the costs it incurs due to possible infringements.

5.2 ANYDESK is entitled to immediately block the software functionalities if there is reasonable suspicion that the use is abusive in the sense described in section 5.1 and/or infringes the rights of third parties. A reasonable suspicion of illegality and/or infringement of rights exists in particular if courts, authorities and/or other third parties inform ANYDESK thereof. ANYDESK must notify the customer of the block and the reason for it without delay. The block must be lifted as soon as the suspicion is invalidated.

5.3 Insofar as the customer collects, processes or uses personal data within the scope of the use of ANYDESK's services and no statutory permissible circumstance applies, the prior consent of the respective data subject must always be obtained. In this respect, ANYDESK and its vicarious agents shall be indemnified against all claims by third parties based on the customer's unlawful use of the products and the services associated therewith. If the customer recognises or must recognise that such an infringement is imminent, ANYDESK must be informed immediately. If, in addition, ANYDESK is to process special data within the meaning of Art. 9 GDPR, the customer must inform ANYDESK of this in writing without delay.

5.4 Personal access data (identification and password) shall comply with current recommendations of the Federal Office for Information Security and may not be disclosed to third parties and shall be kept protected from access by third parties.

7.2 The customer undertakes, at the request of ANYDESK, to permit the audit (verification of compliance with the rights of use of the services provided) as to whether the customer's use of the services is in accordance with the rights granted to the customer under Clause 6, provided that there is a justified interest. A justified interest exists if there is a reasonable suspicion that the Customer has exceeded his right of use. The customer shall be notified by ANYDESK in writing or text form prior to the audit. The date of the audit and the manner in which it is to be carried out shall also be agreed between the Parties in advance. The customer undertakes to assist ANYDESK with the audit and to support ANYDESK in this to a reasonable extent as well as to grant sufficient access to information. In addition, the Customer undertakes to pay any underpaid fees within 30 days of a written request to do so. If payment is not made, ANYDESK is entitled to terminate the contractual relationship without notice. The customer agrees that ANYDESK is not liable for any costs incurred as a result of assisting with an audit. ANYDESK assures the customer that it will protect confidential information as well as the customer's trade and business secrets within the scope of the licence audit and that it will comply with the applicable rules of data protection.

8.4 The payment obligation is based on the services purchased and not on the actual use of the services.

8.5 The number of end-devices as well as the number of authorised users (named users) for which the services are purchased cannot be reduced during the current term of the contract.

10. Warranties

10.1 According to the current state of the art, data communication via the Internet or WLAN cannot be guaranteed to be completely secure, error-free and/or available at all times. ANYDESK therefore fundamentally does not guarantee the availability of its service at all times or accept liability for any disappointed trust of the user in its error-free function.

10.2 Technical data, specifications and performance information in public statements, in particular in advertising material, are not quality information. The functionality of the software shall initially be determined by the contents of the respective service description and any supplementary agreements made in this respect. In addition, the software must be suitable for the use assumed under this contract and otherwise have a quality that is customary for software of the same type.

10.3 The software shall be provided to the customer and maintained in a condition suitable for use in accordance with the contract. The obligation to maintain does not include the adaptation of the software to changed conditions of use and technical and functional developments, such as changes to the IT environment, in particular changes to the hardware or the operating system, adaptation to the functional scope of competing products or establishing compatibility with new data formats.

10.4 No-fault liability for damages for defects present at the point of contract conclusion is excluded.

10.5 The Customer shall assist ANYDESK in identifying and remedying defects.

10.6 In the event of material defects in standard software supplied by third parties and in the event of performance assistance by third parties, ANYDESK is entitled to assign to the Customer, with discharge of debt, corresponding claims against suppliers, the manufacturer or other third parties for the purpose of rectification or replacement delivery, unless this is unreasonable for the Customer. The above also applies if ANYDESK has adapted, configured or otherwise modified the software or hardware for the customer's needs, unless the material defect was caused by ANYDESK's own performance.

10.7 The customer must notify ANYDESK of defects without delay. Claims for defects are subject to a limitation period of one year. The Customer shall inform ANYDESK of defects without undue delay. Warranty claims shall lapse after one year.

In the event of slight negligence, ANYDESK shall be liable without limitation in the event of injury to life, limb and health. In other respects, ANYDESK is only liable for slight negligence if an obligation is breached, the fulfilment of which is a prerequisite for the proper execution of the contract, the breach of which jeopardises the achievement of the purpose of the contract and the observance of which the customer can regularly rely on (so-called cardinal obligation). In the event of a breach of a cardinal obligation, liability shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the contract. This also applies to lost profit and missed savings. Liability for other remote consequential harm caused by a defect is excluded.

11.2 ANYDESK's strict liability for damages (Section 536a BGB) for defects existing at the time of conclusion of the contract is excluded No-fault liability of ANYDESK for damages (Section 536a BGB) for defects present at the time of contract conclusion is excluded.

11.3 Liability for all other damages is excluded. This applies in particular to data losses or hardware disruptions caused by incompatibility of the components existing on the Customer's end devices or IT systems with the new hardware and software or the hardware and software to be changed and for system disruptions that may arise due to existing misconfigurations or older, disruptive drivers that have not been completely removed. This also applies in particular to data losses caused by the customer's failure to carry out data backups himself and thereby ensure that lost data can be restored with reasonable effort.

11.4 Liability under the provisions of the Product Liability Act remains unaffected. Liability in accordance with the provisions of the German Product Liability Act is unaffected.

12. Data Protection

12.1 ANYDESK processes the Customer's personal data in accordance with the data protection provisions of the German Federal Data Protection Act ("BDSG") in the version applicable as of 25 May 2018 and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation - "GDPR").

12.3 Before using the contractual services, the Customer undertakes to check whether personal data is processed on behalf of the Customer as a controller within the meaning of Article 4 No. 7 of the German Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In case, personal data is being processed on behalf of the Customer as a controller within the meaning of Article 4 No. 7 of the GDPR while using the contractual services of ANYDESK, the provisions of the agreement on the processing of personal data (DPA) shall apply in accordance with Article 28 (3) of the GDPR.

14. Amendments to the Terms and Conditions, Service Specifications and Prices

14.1 If ANYDESK intends to change these General and Supplementary Terms and Conditions or the prices, the customer will be notified at least four weeks before the intended validity of the respective amendments. If the Customer rejects the intended changes, the contractual relationship shall continue under the previous conditions. In the event that the continuation is only possible for ANYDESK with disproportionately high effort or disproportionately high costs, ANYDESK is entitled to a special right of termination with a notice period of three months from the time the changes take effect. The same applies in the event that safety-relevant changes to the services or mandatory statutory provisions prevent a continuation of the contractual relationship under the previous conditions. Any advance payments shall be refunded accordingly on a pro rata basis. If the customer does not give written notice of termination within four weeks after receipt of the notice of change, the changes shall become part of the contract at the time they take effect. ANYDESK shall expressly draw the customer's attention to this consequence in the notification of change.

14.2 ANYDESK further reserves the right to deactivate software versions that are no longer current at any time after an update and to discontinue support for them. The deactivation will be displayed online at least six weeks beforehand when the client software is called up.

14.3 ANYDESK is entitled to use the name and logo of the customer as a reference. The Customer may revoke this consent at any time. A simple note, e.g. by e-mail, is sufficient.

The contractual relationship may be terminated in writing by either contracting party with three months' notice at the earliest at the end of the minimum contract term. If no notice of termination is given, the term of the contract shall be extended by one year in each case and may be terminated by either contracting party with three months' notice to the end of the respective extension period. The mere change in the number of users shall not affect the term of the contract.

15.3 The aforementioned dates and periods shall also apply to partial terminations of services, such as changes in the terminal equipment used. The above terms and deadlines shall also apply to terminations of parts of services, e.g. a change in the number of users.

15.5 Notice of termination may be given in writing by letter or via the customer portal https://my.anydesk.com.
