Licensing and Registration

Is VMware Workstation Free?
VMware Workstation has multiple licensing options depending on your use case. 
Workstation Player is available Free for personal, non-commercial use, but
requires a license for commercial use. A valid Commercial license will remove
the ‘Non-commercial use only’ banner placed within the product.
VMware Workstation Pro requires a paid license for personal and commercial uses,
with different terms for each as defined by the VMware Product Guide



How do I register my copy of VMware Workstation Pro with VMware?

If you purchased the product from the VMware Online store, your license key is
automatically registered. If you purchased from a reseller, you may need to
manually register your license key in Customer Connect. Please consult this
KB article for detailed instructions on license key registration.


 
Can I switch between Windows and Linux versions?

Yes. You can switch between Windows and Linux versions of VMware Workstation Pro
using the same license key. If you decide to switch host operating systems, you
must uninstall Workstation Pro from the host operating system you no longer plan
to use. If you plan to run VMware Workstation Pro on a Linux host and a Windows
host, you need to purchase two licenses.



Can I use Workstation on Mac operating systems?

While Workstation Pro and Player do not run on macOS, the licenses are compatible
with VMware Fusion Pro and Fusion Player for Mac, respectively. VMware allows you
to use your personal Workstation Pro or Player license to run virtual machines,
containers and Kubernetes clusters on up to 3 devices that you personally own,
including Apple devices. To facilitate this, a Workstation 16 Pro license can be
used to license VMware Fusion 12 Pro, and a Workstation 16 Player license can be
used to license VMware Fusion 12 Player as 1 of the total 3 devices entitled. 
Corporate accounts must purchase 1 commercial license for each unique device.
