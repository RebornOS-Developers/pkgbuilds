# megasync

Easy automated syncing between your computers and your MEGA cloud drive

**WARNING**: ***megasync*** changed to ***megasync-bin*** in the PKGBUILD (This is done since cnchi installs the package named megasync, and megasync-bin is the only one that is up to date). So megasync contains megasync-bin.

How to clone this repo:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/rebornos-team/rebornos-packages/cloud/megasync.git
